## From Genes to Rhythms: Autism Polygenic Risk and Sleep-Circadian Timing of Adults in the UK Biobank

Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition and sleep disruption is a prevalent feature of autism, and it is suspected that this is mediated through a core deficit in circadian rhythms. Such rhythms are comprised of endogenous timing mechanisms that regulate the sleep-wake cycle, among other life functions, and repeats roughly every 24 hours.


Common genetic variations linked to autism have been found to overlap with those contributing significantly to sleep traits and chronotype (i.e. individual natural preference for sleep and wake times).


Polygenic risk score (PRS) estimates an individualâ€™s genetic risk for a disease or trait by calculating the effect of many common variants linked to the condition.


The existence of a shared genetic architecture between autism and sleep traits is currently unclear and requires further investigation.

#The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between polygenic risk scores for autism and sleep traits (chronotype, sleep duration and insomnia).
